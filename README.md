# Cres Café (Client App)

"Cres Café" is a React Native project developed for a canteen management app. The app was built as part of a hackathon called "Cresathon" by the Team 404 Not Found and utilizes AWS Amplify as the backend service.

### About Cres Café

The purpose of the "Cres Café" app is to provide an efficient and convenient solution for managing and ordering food in a canteen setting. The app allows users, such as students or employees, to browse through a menu, place orders, and make payments seamlessly. It was initially built using Expo later converted to Native project.

AWS Amplify serves as the backend service for the app. It provides a range of features and services that simplify the development and deployment of mobile and web applications. Amplify handles tasks such as user authentication, data models, and API integration, allowing the developers to focus on building the app's core functionality.

Some key features of the "Cres Café" app may include:

User Authentication: The app allows users to create accounts or log in using their existing credentials. This feature ensures that each user has a personalized experience and can access their order history.

Menu Browsing: Users can view the menu of available food items, along with their descriptions, prices, and images. The menu can be categorized into different sections for ease of browsing.

Order Placement: Users can add items to their cart and place orders for pickup or delivery. They can customize their orders by selecting options such as quantity, toppings, or preferences.

Payment Integration: The app incorporates a secure payment system provided by Razorpay, allowing users to make payments using various methods such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or in-app credits.

Order Tracking: Users can track the status of their orders, receiving updates such as confirmation, preparation, and delivery. This feature ensures transparency and helps users stay informed about their orders.

You can start the project using the following command
```bash
